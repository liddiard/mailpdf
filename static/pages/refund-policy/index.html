      <h1>Mail a PDF Online Refund Policy</h1>
      
      <p>Mail a PDF Online ("we") provides refunds only for verifiable technical errors for which we are at fault (as opposed to third party services used we use to fulfill services including, but not limited to, third party APIs and mail carriers) which cause advertised service to not be rendered in a manner which we are unable to correct. We will make a good faith effort to investigate technical errors, but we retain sole discretion in determining the validity and fault of technical error claims.</p> 

      <p>We processes PDFs, including page resizing, to make them compatible with the third party services we use to print and send mail. Users will be given an opportunity to view the processed PDF after uploading and prior to checkout. Users are responsible for determining that the processed PDF is suitable for shipping. We do not assume any responsibility for errors or undesired modifications from the original uploaded document a result of this automated processing.</p>

      <p>We do not provide refunds for any other reason, including, but not limited to, failure of delivery due to incorrect addressing or mail carrier errors, damaged mail, erroneous software or physical processing of mail, or other errors made by third parties in the fulfillment of service.</p>

      <p>Certified and registered mail services are provided by the United States Postal Service ("USPS"). Please direct any inquiries regarding the fulfillment of these services to USPS.</p>
